# TRANSMISSION-simulation Repository

## Project Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to simulate and analyze the effects of fading in wireless communication systems under varying modulation techniques. Specifically, the project investigates the transition introduced in 3GPP Release 5, where prior modulation schemes were replaced by 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The MATLAB application developed in this repository aims to model and visualize these effects, providing insights into the performance trade-offs of different modulation methods.

## Motivation  
This project is motivated by an academic interest in advanced modulation techniques and their practical implications in telecommunications. It seeks to study the rationale behind the design choices made in 3GPP Release 5 through simulation results and structured analysis.

## Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into two primary directories:  

### 1. `DOCUMENTATION/`  
This directory contains the **TRANSMISSION_git.pdf** document, which formalizes a set of test cases. It analyzes the 3GPP decision to adopt 16-QAM and 64-QAM in Release 5 by presenting results obtained from simulations. The documentation focuses on the system-level perspective and does not include technical details about code implementation.  

### 2. `CODE/`  
This directory contains the MATLAB source code used for simulating the effects of fading on systems with 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulation schemes.

## Scope of the Project  
This repository provides:  
- MATLAB simulations to evaluate the impact of fading on systems using 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulations.  
- Documentation analyzing the design choices of 3GPP Release 5 through simulation results.  

For more information, refer to **TRANSMISSION_git.pdf** in the `DOCUMENTATION/` directory or explore the source code in the `CODE/` directory.
