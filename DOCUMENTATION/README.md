# README for `DOCUMENTATION/` Directory

## Overview  
The `DOCUMENTATION/` directory contains the **TRANSMISSION_git.pdf**, which serves as the primary documentation for the project. This document formalizes test cases and analyzes the transition in 3GPP Release 5, where 16-QAM and 64-QAM replaced previous modulation schemes.

## Contents of `TRANSMISSION_git.pdf`  

### 1. Formalized Test Cases  
The document outlines the specific test cases simulated in MATLAB to study the impact of fading on systems employing 16-QAM and 64-QAM.

### 2. Analysis of 3GPP Release 5 Design Choices  
Using simulation results, the document evaluates the performance trade-offs and justifications for adopting 16-QAM and 64-QAM in the context of fading channels.

## Important Notes  
- The **TRANSMISSION_git.pdf** document focuses on system-level analysis and does not include technical explanations of the MATLAB code implementation.  
- Its purpose is to bridge the gap between simulation results and their relevance to 3GPP Release 5 design decisions.  

For additional information, refer to the MATLAB code in the `CODE/` directory.
